/++ Serverino is a small and ready-to-go http server, in D. It is multiplatform
+ and compiles with DMD, LDC and GDC.
+
+ The following example shows how to create a server that responds to all requests
+ with the request dump, in a few lines of code.
+ ---
+ import serverino;
+ mixin ServerinoMain;
+ void hello(const Request req, Output output) { output ~= req.dump(); }
+ ---
+ `serverino.interfaces.Request` is the request object received, and `serverino.interfaces.Output` is the output you can write to.
+
+ A more complete example is the following:
+
+ ---
+ import serverino;
+ mixin ServerinoMain;
+
+ @onServerInit ServerinoConfig setup()
+ {
+    ServerinoConfig sc = ServerinoConfig.create(); // Config with default params
+    sc.addListener("127.0.0.1", 8080);
+    sc.setWorkers(2);
+    // etc...
+
+    return sc;
+ }
+
+ @endpoint
+ void dump(const Request req, Output output) { output ~= req.dump(); }
+
+ @endpoint @priority(1)
+ @route!"/hello"
+ void hello(const Request req, Output output) { output ~= "Hello, world!"; }
+ ---
+
+ The function decorated with `serverino.config.onServerInit` is called when the server is initialized, and it is
+ used to configure the server. It must return a `serverino.config.ServerinoConfig` object.
+ In this example, the server is configured to listen on localhost:8080, with 2 workers.
+
+ Every function decorated with `serverino.config.endpoint` is an endpoint. They are called in order of priority assigned with
+ `serverino.config.priority` (default is 0). The first endpoint that write something to the output is the one that will respond to the request.
+
+ The `serverino.config.route` attribute can be used to filter the requests that are passed to the endpoint, using a path or a `bool delegate(Request r)` argument.
+ In this example, only requests to `/hello` are passed to the `hello` endpoint. The `serverino.config.route` attribute can be used multiple times to specify multiple routes also using a delegate.
